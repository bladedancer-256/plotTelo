# plotTelo


This package allows you to visualize the telomeric regions 
in the human chromosomes with user-defined .bed data.


### Quickstart

Have the packages ```dplyr```, ```tidyr```, and ```karyoploteR``` installed before.
(using the ```install.packages('packageName')``` command)

Install the plotTelo R package this Github repository.

Use the plotTelo function with a URL to your raw bed file OR a file path to your local bed file.

```plotTelo(/home/User/data/myData.bed)```
OR
```plotTelo(raw.github.com/myrepo/mydada.bed)``` (please be careful to link to your RAW data, and not a HTML page!) 



Done!
